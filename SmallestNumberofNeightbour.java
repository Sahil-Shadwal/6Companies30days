// There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1. Given the array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities fromi and toi, and given the integer distanceThreshold.

// Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities i and j is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.
