// 3154. Find Number of Ways to Reach the K-th Stair
// Hard
// Topics
// Companies
// Hint
// You are given a non-negative integer k. There exists a staircase with an infinite number of stairs, with the lowest stair numbered 0.

// Alice has an integer jump, with an initial value of 0. She starts on stair 1 and wants to reach stair k using any number of operations. If she is on stair i, in one operation she can:

// Go down to stair i - 1. This operation cannot be used consecutively or on stair 0.
// Go up to stair i + 2jump. And then, jump becomes jump + 1.
// Return the total number of ways Alice can reach stair k.

// Note that it is possible that Alice reaches the stair k, and performs some operations to reach the stair k again.

class Solution {
    public int waysToReachStair(int k) {
        // Let's say we have `down` operation 1 and `jump` operation 2.
        // The final stair is 1 + (2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(jump - 1)) - down = k.
        // => 1 + (2^jump - 1) - down = k.
        // => down = 2^jump - k.
        // Since `down` operations cannot be used consecutively, there're jump + 1
        // positions (before and after each `jump`) for `down`. The maximum jump is
        // 29, as it satisfies the condition down = 2^jump - k <= jump + 1, with k
        // being the maximum value of 10^9.
